# Simple PulseChain load testing tool

This set of scripts emulates concurrent  send transactions between selected number of PulseChain accounts. Basic idea is to spin up numerous processes which perform send transactions in a loop, but only if the account ballance is sufficient.

You need Linux and NodeJS to run this tool. Then install the needed NPM modules withing the working directory:
```
npm install web3
```

## How to use

- Clone repo and change to main directory
- Install the web3 npm package
- Run create-wallets.sh
- Run run-agents.sh

## Configuration

Default configuration assumes:
- Using 100 wallets - to change this modify `create-wallets.sh`.
- PulseChain Web Socket node running on localhost - to chainge this modify the value of `rpcNodeURL` in `agent.js`.

To create wallets simply run:
```
./create-wallets.sh
```
this creates lots of wallets and stores them in `./wallets/` directory.

## Running the load test

**At this point you should faucet some tPLS to any of addresses create by the script above!**

Now you can run the agents:
```
./run-agents.sh
```
At the beginning of execution some of the agents may report starving becuase they will have no PLS. But after some time the PLS will be spread bettwen wallets.
